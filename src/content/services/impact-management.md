# Impact Management

Building effective impact management systems requires more than just good intentions—it requires robust frameworks, clear protocols, and alignment with international standards.

## Systems Approach

We help organizations develop comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems that track progress, identify improvement opportunities, and ensure accountability to stakeholders.

## Standards Alignment

Our frameworks align with global standards including ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems and greenhouse gas accounting protocols across all emission scopes.
